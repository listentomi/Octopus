        SemQL has the issue that joins are not modeled explicitly - which makes sense as a user most probably will not mention them. Still though there
        are situations where there are important - for example when a join will restrict the resulting dataset as only samples with relations in both tables
        will be showed.
        To account for that we model such joins in SemQL as nested queries: SELECT XY FROM table_A WHERE id in (SELECT id FROM table_B).

        Even though this is not always 100% correct (what we do is a SEMI JOIN which has a slightly different behaviour) it solves the problem quite well.

        xÂ§This example has is an extreme version of this rule.
