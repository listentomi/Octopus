# Octopus: An Auto-Generated Multidimensional Fine-Grained Benchmark for Evaluating Text-to-SQL Systems

This repository contains the training dataset, validation dataset (`benchmark_data`)ï¼Œthe generation code (`src`) and the evaluation code (`evaluation code`) of Octopus to guarantee the reproducibility of our benchmark.

We will release our own leaderboard website soon. Therefore, we will not disclose the testing set of our dataset to ensure the fairness of our leaderboard.
